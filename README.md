This is a simple e-commerce website that sells watches.
The creator has used three languages in its creation; HTML, CSS and JS. 
For JS,he has implemented three functions as follows; 
a) On clicking the logo, an alert message is generated.
b)Search functionality.
c) form functinality, in creation of username and password in the webpage
The website is a simple only having the front-end bit of code. As search the functions are not executionable as would be expected.
